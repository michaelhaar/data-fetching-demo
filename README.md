This repo demonstrates how someone can implement **fullstack type safety** using:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (especially [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations))
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (for data fetching, caching, and synchronization)
- [zod](https://zod.dev/) (for input/output validation in API endpoints #goodpractice)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
